# asteroids
Asteroids game built using Python and Pygame!

Project Overview
This project was my introduction to building multi-file Python applications using object-oriented programming (OOP). I created a simple physics-based game that allowed me to practice real-world programming patterns in a fun and engaging way. The focus wasn’t on mastering game development or physics math, but rather on writing meaningful, organized, and reusable code across multiple files.

Key Features
Modular Multi-File Architecture – I structured the project across multiple Python files to improve organization and scalability.

Object-Oriented Game Design – I used classes and encapsulation to model game objects and their interactions, which made the code more manageable and intuitive.

Focused Learning Approach – I wrote the most important parts of the code myself, while some of the more complex or less relevant portions were provided, allowing me to focus on core concepts without getting bogged down.

Technical Skills Demonstrated
Organizing and managing multi-file Python projects

Implementing object-oriented principles like classes, methods, and inheritance

Importing and connecting modules effectively in a larger codebase

Challenges and Solutions
One challenge I faced was figuring out how to organize the code so that different modules could work together without breaking. I solved this by carefully planning my file structure and using clear, consistent imports. Adopting an object-oriented mindset also took some practice, but building out the game’s logic through class-based design helped everything click.

Project Outcome and Impact
By the end of this project, I had built a fully functional game that clearly demonstrated how modular, object-oriented code can come together to create something larger and more complex. More importantly, I gained confidence in working with multi-file Python projects—something I had never done before—and now feel more prepared to tackle real-world programming challenges.
